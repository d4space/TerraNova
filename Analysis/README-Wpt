In Wpt differential cross section analysis we use Recoil corrected MET fit to get yields 
and then Unfold it to postFSR(Detector unfolding) and preFSR(FSR unfolding).

1.
To create Recoil parameters run WPtRecoilCorr/
root -l WPtRecoilMakeHisto.C

then Recoil/
./runRecoilFits.sh

this will create recoil parameter to apply on MET.
(it is already created and exists in Terranova  in Recoil/ folder)

2.
Calculate Electron/Muon energy scale and resolution factors to apply on MET before selection
run WPtScaleSmearCorr/
root -l WPtTemplMakeHisto.C

run WPtScaleSmearCorr/
python scaleSmearTemplateFit_Ele(Muon).py

for Electron and Muon cases to get the scale/smear values 
(these values are already calculated and included in EventSelection/Wlnu12LoBase.h, 
so it will be applied when you run MET selection in WPtMET/ folder)
