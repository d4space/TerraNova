Theory Normalization

To run the Code, please see MACRO.

1. MakeRoot_WpT_FEWZ.C
This code makes WpToMuNu_FEWZ.root and WmToMuNu_FEWZ.root file in ./root folder.
The Normalized Differential Cross-section and its error (by using toy method) is saved in root files.
We make W-/W+ plots by using these root files.

2. MakeRoot_WpTincl_FEWZ.C
This code makes WinclMuNu_FEWZ.root file in ./root filder.
The inclusive Normalized Differential Cross-section and its error (by using toy method) is saved in root files.
We use this root file to make Z/W ratio plot.

3. MakeRoot_ZpT_FEWZ.C
This code makes ZToMuMu_FEWZ.root file in ./root filder.
The inclusive Normalized Differential Cross-section and its error (by using toy method) is saved in root files.
We use this root file to make Z/W ratio plot.
